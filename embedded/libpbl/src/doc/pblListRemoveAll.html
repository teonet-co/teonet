<BLOCKQUOTE>
Removes from this list all of its elements
that are contained in the specified collection.

<P>This implementation iterates over this list,
checking each element returned by the iterator in turn
to see if it's contained in the specified collection.

<P>If it's so contained, it's removed from this list
with the iterator's remove method in case of a linked list
and with an optimized direct removal method in case of
an array list.

<P>This method has a time complexity of O(N * M),
with N being the size of the list and M being the size of the
collection.
