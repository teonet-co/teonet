<BLOCKQUOTE>
Inserts the specified element into the underlying collection.

<P>The element is inserted immediately before the next element that would be returned by next,
if any, and after the next element that would be returned by previous, if any.

<P>If the list contains no elements, the new element becomes the sole element on the list.

<P>The new element is inserted before the implicit cursor:
a subsequent call to next would be unaffected,
and a subsequent call to previous would return the new element.
This call increases by one the value that would be returned by a
call to nextIndex or previousIndex.

<P>For array lists this method has a time complexity of O(N),
with N being the number of elements in the underlying list.

<P>For linked lists this method has a time complexity of O(1).
