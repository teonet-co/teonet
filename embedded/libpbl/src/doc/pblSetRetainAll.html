Retains only the elements in this set
that are contained in the specified collection.

<P>In other words, removes from this set all
of its elements that are not contained in the specified collection.

<P>This implementation iterates over this set,
checking each element returned by the iterator in turn
to see if it's contained in the specified collection.

<P>If it's not so contained, it's removed from this set
with the iterator's remove method in case of a tree set
and with a direct removal method in case of
an hash set. This hash set removal has a memory complexity
of O(N), with N being the number of elements to be removed.

<P>This method has a time complexity of O(N * M),
with N being the size of the set and M being the size of the
collection.
