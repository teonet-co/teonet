<BLOCKQUOTE>
Removes from the underlying list or tree set the last element returned by the iterator.

<P>This method can be called only once per call to next or previous.
It can be made only if pblIteratorAdd() has not been called after the last call to next or previous.

<P>For array lists this method has a time complexity of O(N),
with N being the number of elements in the underlying list.

<P>For linked lists and hash sets this method has a time complexity of O(1).

<P>For tree sets this method has a time complexity of O(Log N),
with N being the number of elements in the underlying collection.
