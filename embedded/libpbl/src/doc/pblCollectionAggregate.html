<BLOCKQUOTE>
Aggregates a collection by calling the aggregation function on every element
of the collection while running through the collection with an iterator.

<P>The application context supplied is passed to the aggregation function
for each element.

<P>If the aggregation function for an element returns a value > 0,
the aggregation is terminated immediately and the return value of
the aggregation function is given back to the caller.

<P>Otherwise the aggregation is continued to the next element
of the collection until the iterator reaches its end.

<P>This method has a time complexity of O(N),
with N being the size of the collection.
