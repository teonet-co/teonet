DOC++ automatically imposes a hierarchical stucture to the manual
entries for classes, structs, unions, enums and interfaces, in that it
organizes members of such as sub-entries.

<P>Additionally DOC++ provides means for manually creating subentries to a
manual entry. This is done via <EM>documentation scopes</EM>. A
documentation scope is defined using a pair of brackets:

<P><PRE>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//@{
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//@}
	</PRE>

<P>just like variable scopes in C, C++ or Java. Instead of ``<TT>//@{</TT>'' and
``<TT>//@}</TT>'' one can also use ``<TT>/*@{*</TT><TT>/</TT>'' and ``<TT>/*@}*</TT><TT>/</TT>''. All the
manual entries within a documentation scope are organized as subentries
of the manual entry preceeding the opening bracket of the scope, but
only if this is an explicit manual entry. Otherwise a dummy explicit
manual entry is created.

<P>In addition to this, Java allows the programmer to organize classes
hierarchically by means of ``<TT>package</TT>s''. Packages are directly
represented in the manual entry hierarchy generated by DOC++. When a
DOC++ comment is found before a `<TT>package</TT>' statement, the documentation
is added to the package's manual entry. This functionality as well as
documentation scopes are extensions to the features of JavaDoc.

<P>Similar to Java's packages, C++ comes with the ``<TT>namespace</TT>'' concept.
The idea is to group various class, functions, etc. declarations into
different universes. DOC++ deals with namespaces in the same way it does
with packages.</BLOCKQUOTE>
