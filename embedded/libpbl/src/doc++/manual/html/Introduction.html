The idea of DOC++ is to provide a tool that supports the <EM>programmer</EM>
for writing <EM>high quality</EM> documentation while keeping concentration on
the program development. In order to do so, it is important that the
programmer can add the documentation right into the source code he/she
developes. Only with such an approach, a programmer would really write some
documentation to his/her classes, methods etc. and keep them up to date with
upcoming changes of code. At the same time it must be possible to directly
compile the code without need to a previous filter phase as needed when
using e.g. `cweb'. Hence, the only place where to put documentation are
comments.

<P>This is exactly what DOC++ uses for generating documentation. However,
there are two types of comments the programmer wants to distinguish. One
are comments he/she does for remembering some implementational issues, while
the others are comments for documenting classes, functions etc. such that
he/she or someone else would be able to use the code later on. In DOC++
this distinction is done via different types of comments. Similar to
`JavaDoc', documentation comments are of the following format

<P><UL>
<LI>	<TT>/**&nbsp;...&nbsp;*</TT><TT>/</TT><BR>
<LI>	<TT>///&nbsp;...</TT>
</UL>

<P>where the documentation is given in ``<TT>...</TT>''. Such comments are referred to
as <EM>DOC++ comments</EM>. Each DOC++ comment generates a manual entry for
the <EM>next</EM> declaration in the source code. Trailing comments can be
used to generate manual entries too while being in Quantel mode.

<P>Now, let's consider what ``high quality'' documentation means. Many
programmers like to view the documentation online simply by klicking their
mouse buttons. A standard for such documents is HTML for which good viewers
are available on almost every machine. Hence, DOC++ has been designed to
produce HTML output in a structured way.

<P>But have you ever printed a HTML page?  Doesn't it look ugly, compared to
what one is used to? This is not a problem for DOC++ since it also provides
TeX output for generating high quality hardcopies.

<P>For both ouput formats, it is important that the documentation is well
structured. DOC++ provides hierarchies, that are reflected as
sections/subsections etc., or HTML page hierarchies, respectively. Also an
index is generated that allows the user to easily find what he/she looks
for.

<P>As C++ and Java are (somewhat) object-oriented languages, another type of
hierarchy is introduced, namely class hierarchies. The best way to read
such a hierarchy is by looking at a picture of it. Indeed, DOC++
automatically draws a picture for each class derivation hierarchy or shows
it with a Java applet in the HTML output.

<P>An additional goody of DOC++ is its ability to generate a TeX typeset
source code listing for C and C++ code.</BLOCKQUOTE>
