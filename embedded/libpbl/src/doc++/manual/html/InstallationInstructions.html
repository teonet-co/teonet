The steps in order to compile this package are:

<P><B>1.</B> `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
`./configure' to configure the package for your system. If you're
using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
`sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
`configure' itself.

<P>Running `configure' takes awhile. While running, it prints some messages
telling which features it is checking for.

<P>The `configure' script is generated from `configure.in' by GNU's autoconf
and it attempts to guess correct values for various system-dependent
variables used during compilation. It also creates the Makefiles needed to
compile the package and a `.h' file containing system-dependent
definitions;

<P><B>2.</B> Type `make' to compile the package;

<P><B>3.</B> Type `make install' to install the package. This operation should be
done logged on as root;

<P><B>4.</B> You can remove the object files from the source directory by typing
`make clean'. To also remove the files that `configure' created
(so you can compile the package for a different kind of system), type
`make distclean';

<P><B>5.</B> Type `make uninstall' to remove the package from the destination
directories.

<P><B>Installation directories</B>

<P>By default, `make install' will install the package's binaries in
`/usr/bin'. You can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr'
by giving `configure' the option `--prefix=PATH'.

<P><B>Other features and options</B>

<P>--enable-debug to enable generation of debugging informations; for other
options, type `./configure --help'.</BLOCKQUOTE>
