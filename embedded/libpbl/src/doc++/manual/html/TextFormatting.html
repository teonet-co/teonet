DOC++ provides both HTML and TeX output. Both languages have
formatting macros which are more or less powerful. The idea of DOC++ is
to be able to generate both ouput formats from a single source. Hence,
it is not possible to rely on the full functionality of either
formatting macros. Instead, DOC++ supports a subset of each set of
macros, that has proved to suffice for most applications. However, in
one run of DOC++ the user must decide for the formating macros to use.
The subset of each macro packet is listed in the following subsections.
If one uses only one of the subsets, good looking output can be expected
for both formats.</BLOCKQUOTE>
